# Client_Segmentation_e-Commerce

With this project we aim to:

-Retain existing customers

-Increase their average basket

## Objectives: 
We will seek to create an unsupervised classification model to answer the following questions:
- How many customer segments are there?
- What characterises these segments?
- How often should they be updated?
